# **What is Exception**

## 📝 **1. Types of Errors in Java**

### **1️⃣ Compile-Time Errors**

Compile-time errors occur **before execution**, during compilation.
These are caused by:

  * Incorrect syntax
  * Missing semicolons
  * Invalid variable or method names
  * Missing return statements

If compile-time errors exist, Java **does not generate the `.class` file**, and the program cannot run.

### **2️⃣ Logical Errors**

Logical errors occur when the program executes successfully but produces **incorrect output**.

They happen due to:

  * Wrong formula or logic
  * Incorrect conditions
  * Misplaced operators

The program does **not crash**, but gives the wrong result.

### **3️⃣ Runtime Errors (Exceptions)**

Runtime errors occur **when the program is running**.
These errors are called **Exceptions**, and they **terminate the program** unless properly handled.

Common causes:

  * Division by zero
  * File not found
  * Invalid array index
  * Null value access

## 🚨 **2. What is an Exception?**

An **Exception** is an unexpected event that disturbs the normal program flow.
Java provides a mechanism to handle these problems using:

```java
try
catch
finally
throw
throws
```

Exception handling ensures the program does not crash and handles failures gracefully.

## ⚠️ **3. Types of Exceptions**

Java classifies exceptions into two main categories:

### **A. Checked Exceptions**

Checked at **compile time**.

The compiler forces the programmer to:

  * Handle using `try-catch`, or
  * Declare using `throws`

Common checked exceptions:

  * `IOException`
  * `SQLException`
  * `FileNotFoundException`
  * `ClassNotFoundException`

Used mostly in:

  * File I/O
  * Database operations
  * Network communication

### **B. Unchecked Exceptions**

Checked at **runtime**, not at compile time.
Caused mainly by **programming mistakes**.

Common unchecked exceptions:

  * `NullPointerException`
  * `ArithmeticException`
  * `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
  * `ClassCastException`

Java does **not** force you to handle them.

## 🆚 **4. Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions — Quick Comparison**

| Feature | Checked Exception | Unchecked Exception |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Checked at | Compile time | Runtime |
| Must handle? | Yes | No |
| Reason | External factors | Programmer mistakes |
| Examples | IOException | NullPointerException |

**Key Point:**
➡️ *Both happen at runtime, but only checked exceptions are verified by the compiler.*

## 🌳 **5. Exception Hierarchy (Important\!)**

```text
                Throwable
                 /     \
          Exception    Error
             /   \
      Checked     Unchecked (RuntimeException)
```

### **Error**

  * Not an exception
  * Caused by serious issues (JVM crash, memory limits)
  * Cannot be handled by the program

Examples:
`OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`

## 🏁 **6. Summary**

  * Java has three types of errors → compile-time, logical, runtime
  * Runtime errors are called **Exceptions**
  * Java provides robust exception handling
  * **Checked exceptions → compile-time**, must be handled
  * **Unchecked exceptions → runtime**, due to coding mistakes
  * Exception hierarchy starts from **Throwable**
