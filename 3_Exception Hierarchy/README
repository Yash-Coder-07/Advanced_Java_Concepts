# **Java Exception Hierarchy **

In Java, **exceptions are objects** that represent abnormal or exceptional conditions that occur during program execution.
Java provides a structured **exception class hierarchy** to categorize and handle different types of runtime issues.

# ⭐ **Important Points About Exception Hierarchy**

### ✔ 1. **Every class in Java extends `Object`**

This means the root of all classes (including exceptions) is the **Object class**.

### ✔ 2. **Top-most class in exception system → `Throwable`**

* `Throwable` is the **superclass** of all errors and exceptions.
* It directly extends the `Object` class.

### ✔ 3. `Throwable` has **two main subclasses**:

1. **`Error`**
2. **`Exception`**

# ⭐ **Error**

* Represents **serious problems** that applications should *not* try to handle.
* Usually caused by **JVM-level issues**.
* **Program cannot recover.**
* Examples:

  * `OutOfMemoryError`
  * `StackOverflowError`
  * `VirtualMachineError`

**Interview line:**
➡️ *Errors are not meant to be caught or handled by the application.*

---

# ⭐ **Exception**

* Represents **conditions a program may want to catch and handle**.
* Exceptions are **recoverable**.
* Examples:

  * `IOException`
  * `SQLException`
  * `ArithmeticException`

---

# ⭐ **Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions**

## ✔ **Checked Exceptions**

* **Checked at compile-time.**
* Programmer must:

  * Handle with `try-catch`, OR
  * Declare using `throws`
* If not handled → compile-time error.
* Examples:

  * `IOException`
  * `SQLException`
  * `ClassNotFoundException`

**When used?**
When dealing with **external resources** like files, DB, networks.

---

## ✔ **Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)**

* **Checked at runtime** (NOT at compile-time).
* Compiler does NOT force handling.
* Usually caused by **logic/programming mistakes**.
* Examples:

  * `NullPointerException`
  * `ArithmeticException`
  * `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
  * `ClassCastException`

**When used?**
Logic errors in code.

```

# ⭐ **Quick Interview Summary**

* All exception classes extend **Throwable**.
* `Error` → Serious, unrecoverable issues.
* `Exception` → Recoverable issues, can be handled.
* Checked exceptions → compiler checks them, must be handled.
* Unchecked exceptions → runtime issues, typically coding mistakes.
* `RuntimeException` and its subclasses are **unchecked**.
